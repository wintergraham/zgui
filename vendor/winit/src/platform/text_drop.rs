//! zgx patch: text dragged in from another app (a browser's selection, an
//! editor's) drops where the app's windows say, as it does in AppKit's
//! text views and a browser's fields. Windows hear it while it is over
//! them, and whether they would take it there is the platform's answer to
//! the drag (its pointer's badge, and whether a release drops at all).
//! Files keep their own events (`WindowEvent::DroppedFile`).
//!
//! The text is read once, as it drops: X11 hands it over only then.
